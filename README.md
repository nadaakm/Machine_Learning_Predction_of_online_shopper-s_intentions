# Prediction of Online Shoppers' Intention

This Jupyter notebook provides an analysis and prediction of online shoppers' purchasing intentions based on a variety of factors. The project uses a dataset containing information about visitors to an online shopping website, including details about their browsing behavior, type of visitor, and other relevant features.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To analyze online shopping data and build a model that can predict whether a visitor is likely to make a purchase (`Revenue`), based on their browsing behavior and other features.
- **Dataset**: The notebook uses a dataset titled "Online Shoppers' Intention," which includes attributes such as administrative page views, product-related page views, bounce rates, exit rates, and more.

## Key Steps in the Notebook

1. **Data Loading**:
   - The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
  
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Categorical features such as `VisitorType`, `Weekend`, and `Revenue` are encoded into numeric values using `LabelEncoder`.
  
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Correlation matrix and heatmaps are used to identify relationships between features.
   - Distribution plots are used to visualize the relationship between features like `Administrative` page views and `Revenue`.
  
4. **Feature Correlations**:
   - The notebook explores the correlations between various features, identifying which factors are most strongly associated with the likelihood of making a purchase.

## How to Use

To run the notebook, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. The main dependencies are:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can open and run the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook prediction_of_online_shoppers_intention.ipynb
```

## Results

The notebook provides insights into the factors that influence online shoppers' purchasing decisions and builds a model to predict purchase intentions. The visualizations help in understanding key patterns and correlations in the data.
